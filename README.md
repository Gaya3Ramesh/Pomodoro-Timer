## Description

The Pomodoro Timer is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users manage their time using the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses intervals of focused work (usually 15 minutes) followed by short breaks. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills.
